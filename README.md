# Simple Json Parser 
This Json parser is simple in sense that it does not use any tokens or linked list in which nodes are allocated and freed

It is more like a SAX parser

This parser does not provide you a Json Object or Array which can be altered. 

Using this parser, you are suppose to unpack data onto your own data structures.
